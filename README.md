# Shine: SSBM Stats Viewer

_Shine_, as the title suggests, is a tool that parses [.slp](https://slippi.gg/) files, computes stats, and displays them in a visibly succinct way, Ã  la [MMA stats](https://www.espn.com/mma/fightcenter). _Shine_ strives to add another layer of depth to our favorite game: _Super Smash Bros. Melee_. ~~(and maybe another way to tell your friend no johns, or explain why Fox-Marth is _actually_ 60-40.)~~
